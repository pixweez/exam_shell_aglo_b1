ELLIOT (V.O.)

Hello friend. Hello friend? That’s lame. Maybe I should give you a name? 
But that’s a slippery slope. You’re only in my head. We have to remember that.

It’s actually happened. I’m talking to an imaginary person.
Loud, violent jazz RISES on the soundtrack. Within the black of frame,
silhouettes begin forming.
